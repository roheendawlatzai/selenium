Handling multiple windows:
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
window handle is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab
It is approximately 40 alphanumeric character ID

Thread.sleep() - static wait / unconditional wait

Types of selenium waits:
Implicit
Explicit
Fluent

Implicit Wait:
it tells the wedriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
it will be written only once and will be applied for the whole session of the execution
We can say the implicit wait is a global wait

Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If your element is found in any time before the given time
the rest of the time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next action

If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then you will get an exception
